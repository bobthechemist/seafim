# (SEAFIM) Seabreeze Flame Interface for Mathematica

This program is a simple interface for controlling the Ocean Optics FLAME spectrometer using Mathematica.  It consists of a *driver* which was written in c and a Mathematica package.

The driver is a c program that takes configuration information as options and spits out x,y data.  The x data are the wavelengths and y data are the pixel intensities at those wavelengths.  

## Setup

Install the Seabreeze SDK (I need to remember how) 

## Usage

Work in progress
